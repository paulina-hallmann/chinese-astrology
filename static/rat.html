        <p> Rats are known for their resourcefulness and ability to find solutions to problems. They are intelligent, clever and charming. Thanks to their wit and charism they can easily win people over. These creatures are often flexible and able to adjust to changing circumstances. People born under this sign are ambitious and driven individuals. They are not afraid to work hard to achieve their goals and are often determined to succeed. 
        Despite their inteligence they are still outgoing and enjoy the company of others. While Rats are ambitious, they are also cautious by nature. They tend to weigh their options carefully before making decisions and are not prone to taking unnecessary risks. They are good at managing their finances and are often careful with their money.

                  This love compatibility is at its best when the Dragon leads at a high level, making the bigger decisions the Rat struggles with, while the Rat takes care of the details that the Dragon will likely overlook.
